# My idea to realize while learning Go
An app with Go + Gin as the backend and Nuxt3 as the frontend.
The magnificent TODO app.
- [ ] Backend written in Go
- [ ] Frontend written in Nuxt3
  - [ ] Storing session data with Pinia
  - [ ] Scripting with TS

## Features to be implemented
- [ ] Managing Tasks
  - [ ] Create a Task
  - [ ] Modify a Task
  - [ ] Delete a Task
  - [ ] Complete a Task
- [ ] Display the complete list of Tasks
- [ ] Search for a task with a name containing provided string (no idea what algorithm to implement, so may as well go with some simple regex pattern matching over a list)

## Side goals
- [ ] Stylize the website with UnoCSS or something similar
- [ ] Write REST API test requests with Hoppscotch
